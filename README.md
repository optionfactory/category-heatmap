# Heatmap by category

Differently from Grafana's Heatmap plugin, this one draws a heatmap based on categories, not only on the timeline.
This allows you to view, for example, histograms over app versions.

To work with this plugin run:
```
make watch-in-docker
```

or
```
yarn watch
```

To build the plugin run:
```
make build-in-docker
```

or
```
yarn build
```
